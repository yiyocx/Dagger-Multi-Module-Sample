# Dagger-Multi-Module-Sample
Repo created to show an architecture for multi-module Android projects using Dagger.

This project was inspired by the architecture proposed in [this](https://medium.com/traveloka-engineering/dagger-and-multi-module-traveloka-android-app-c6c42b63db3f) article.

The purpose of this repo is to facilitate the understanding and implementation of the architecture proposed 
in the article mentioned above since some parts are not fully explained and it can be difficult to fill 
in these empty spaces for your project. 

I especially want to thank [@lifaalifalifa](https://twitter.com/lifaalifalifa) for their help clarifying some doubts I had in creating this code base.
